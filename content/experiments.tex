\section{Experiments / Results}
\label{sec:experiments}

\textit{Benchmarks (test results) and possibly competition results. Include explanations and analyses of your results. As mentioned under “Benchmarks and comparisons” below, it is usually a clear strength if you have some results to com- pare, e.g. two different versions of your client with different methods/features/parameters. You could also compare the behaviour of your client on different individual levels that illustrate a certain point, e.g. similar levels resulting in large differences in the client’s behaviour.}
