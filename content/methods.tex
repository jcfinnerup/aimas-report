\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\textit{How does your client work? Describe its overall algorithmic functionality as clearly and precisely as possible, without going into any implementation details. Describe it in terms of the theories you rely on (as presented in background). Include small, illustrative examples of how the client works. Aim to describe your client suffi- ciently precisely that a reader being an expert in the field would be able to implement a similar solution based on your description (note that this is not an encouragement to describe implementation details, but rather make sure that the overall structure and ideas of your implementation are sufficiently precise).s}
