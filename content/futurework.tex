\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

\textit{What are the most immediate possible extensions or generalisations of your work? How would you develop it further if you had more time? Does your method generalise to other types of domain? If not, what would be required for it to do so? Sometimes it makes most sense to integrate discussion and future work into a single section. Future work should focus on immediate extensions that you more or less would know how to implement, it shouldnâ€™t be very speculative extensions that are not even quite clear to yourself.}
